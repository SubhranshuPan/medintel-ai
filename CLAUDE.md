# MedIntel AI — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
MedIntel AI — a five-pillar clinical intelligence platform: patient data platform, clinical analytics dashboard, ML risk-prediction engine with SHAP explainability, RAG-based AI decision support, and reporting/export. This is a career-critical portfolio project (not a hobby build) targeting UK healthcare/health-tech data science and ML engineering roles. Full context: `.agents/AGENTS.md` (read first) and `.ai/BOOTSTRAP.md`.

### Binding Scope Mandate (do not silently scope this down)
MedIntel AI is not a demo RAG chatbot. It must remain, end to end, a **production-grade, industry-valuable healthcare data science platform**: multiple predictive ML models (not just one), a real MLOps stack (experiment tracking, model registry, continuous training, monitoring, A/B testing), a rigorous evaluation/fairness framework, and privacy/compliance architecture (HIPAA/GDPR-ready). Full detail and roadmap: `docs/00_VISION_ML_PLATFORM.md`. Never quietly drop or water down these components to save time — if a timeline conflict shows up, surface it explicitly to Som (as a flagged risk/tradeoff) rather than silently descoping. This mandate was set 2026-07-14 and supersedes any earlier "keep it minimal" framing elsewhere in this file or in `.ai/`.

## Tech Stack (per ADRs in `docs/architecture/adr/`)
| Layer | Choice | ADR |
|---|---|---|
| Backend API | FastAPI | ADR-001 |
| Frontend | React | ADR-002 |
| Relational DB | PostgreSQL | ADR-003 |
| Vector DB | Qdrant | ADR-004 |
| LLM orchestration | LangChain | ADR-005 |
| Containerization | Docker | ADR-006 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | ADR-007 |
| Architecture style | Modular monolith | ADR-008 |
| Data versioning | Dataset versioning scheme | ADR-009 |
| Model serving | ML model serving pattern | ADR-010 |
| Explainability | SHAP | ADR-011 |
| Reporting | PDF/export pipeline | ADR-012 |

Don't propose a different stack for core pillars without flagging it as an ADR-worthy deviation first.

## Domain & Portfolio Requirements
- Use healthcare-domain terminology (readmission risk, clinical pathway, patient cohort, ICD codes) — not generic tech jargon.
- Treat all data as if it were real PHI even though it's synthetic: GDPR-aware handling, no shortcuts that wouldn't fly with real patient data.
- Explainability is not optional — any predictive model needs SHAP output, since that's what NHS/UK regulators and interviewers care about.
- Code, docs, and commits should read as senior-engineer output — recruiter-readable, interview-defensible. Document non-trivial decisions as ADRs (19 exist already in `docs/architecture/adr/`).
- Don't dumb the project down or default to tutorial-tier patterns.

## Workflow & Branch Policy
- All work stays on `develop`. Do not propose or perform a `develop` → `main` merge — `main` updates only once a basic first-draft product exists. Don't flag "main is behind develop" as an action item.
- Report-only autonomy: propose changes, let Som approve; never auto-merge PRs.
- **Never push directly to `develop`** (set 2026-07-14, after `b42c1fe` went straight to `develop`). *Every* commit lands via a feature branch and a PR — including bookkeeping-only changes (`.ai/memory/*`, doc touch-ups, scope-status edits). There is no "too small for a PR" category. Branch naming follows the existing pattern (`docs/…`, `fix/…`, `feat/…`).
- Git writes go through the **`gh` CLI**, not the GitHub MCP server — the MCP token is read-only and 403s on writes (`create_pull_request`, labels, milestones, releases). Use the MCP for reads. `git push` and `gh` are both authenticated; don't assume credentials are missing without testing.
- Project status: Sprint 0 (docs/architecture, 12 ADRs) is complete. Sprint 1 (backend foundation — auth, data models, API skeleton, issues #5–#10) is complete — 11/11 issues, milestone closed 2026-07-12. Sprint 2 (Patient Data Platform — dataset models, audit logging, CSV upload/object storage, issues #30–#32) is in progress; #33/#34 (schema validation, dataset management endpoints) are next.

## Session-End Checklist (mandatory — Cowork and Claude Code, do this without being asked)
- If any file changed this session (code, config, docs, ADRs): append a dated entry to `.ai/memory/session-history.md`, using the template already at the top of that file. Do this automatically at the end of the session, before signing off — don't wait for Som to request it.
- If a significant decision was made (architecture, scope, tooling, tradeoffs): also add/update `.ai/memory/project-memory.md`.
- If nothing in the working tree changed (pure discussion, planning, or research with no files touched): skip — don't create an empty log entry.
- Writing the memory entry is bookkeeping, not a git action — it's exempt from report-only autonomy, so do it unprompted. Landing it is *not* exempt: the edit sits in the working tree like any other doc change and goes through a feature branch + PR (see Branch Policy above — no direct pushes to `develop`, and no auto-merge). Don't `git add`/`commit`/`push` without Som asking.
- Safety net: the `medintel-morning-repo-briefing` scheduled task (9:10 AM weekdays) checks the next morning and appends a session-history.md entry itself if it finds repo activity that wasn't logged — so a missed entry gets caught within a day either way.

## Model Routing (Token Optimization)

This project uses a **two-model workflow** to minimize token costs:

| Phase     | Model  | Command     | Purpose                              |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Planning  | Opus   | `/plan`     | Deep research, architecture, design  |
| Execution | Sonnet | `/execute`  | Code changes, following the plan     |
| Status    | Any    | `/status`   | Check plan progress                  |

### When to Suggest Opus Planning
If you detect the task involves ANY of the following, suggest the user switch to Opus and use `/plan`:
- New feature development spanning multiple files
- Architectural changes or refactors
- Complex debugging requiring deep codebase analysis
- Database schema changes
- API design decisions
- Security-sensitive changes
- Infrastructure or deployment changes

Say: _"This looks like a complex task. Consider running `/model` to switch to Opus, then `/plan <task>` for a thorough plan. You can switch back to Sonnet for execution."_

### When to Proceed Directly (Sonnet)
Handle these tasks immediately without suggesting Opus:
- Simple bug fixes and typos
- Formatting and style changes
- Adding comments or documentation
- Small, isolated code changes
- Running commands or checking status

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
- Preserve existing comments unrelated to your changes
